                <span>1. What is Organ Donation?<br></span>
Organ donation is donating or gifting one’s organs to other person who is suffering from end stage organ failure and needs organ transplant for his survival.<br><br>
<span>2. What is Organ Transplantation?<br></span>
Transplantation is a surgical process of removing an organ from one person and implanting it into another person’s body. The person who gives the organs is called a donor while a person who receives the organ is called a recipient.<br><br>
<span>3. What are the types of Organ Donation?<br></span>
Organ donation is of two types:<br>
Living donor organ donation:<br>
This takes place when a living person donates an organ or a part of an organ for transplantation to another person.<br>
Deceased donor organ donation:<br>
This takes place when a dead person (after Brain Stem death) donates organs for transplantation to other persons.<br><br>
<span>4. Who can be donor?<br></span>
Anyone from a child to an old person can be a donor. Even if you had a serious illness in the past, you can still become a donor under the right circumstances.<br><br>
<span>5. Which organs can be donated?<br></span>
Organs that can be harvested from a person for transplantation include lungs, liver, heart, kidneys, intestines and pancreas. Certain tissues like corneas, heart valves, bones, skin, ligaments/tendons and veins can be donated.<br><br>
<span>6. What is brain death?<br></span>
Brain death results from a severe, irreversible injury to the brain due to which the brain no longer functions, thus a person cannot sustain his/her<br>
own life. However, vital body functions may be maintained by an artificial support system which maintain circulation to vital organs long enough to facilitate organ donation. People who experience brain death also donate tissues.<br><br>
<span>7. What is cardiac death?<br></span>
Cardiac death results when the heart and breathing stop functioning. All organs and tissues in the body suffer from lack of oxygen, circulation and die.<br><br>
<span>8. What is the difference between brain death and coma?<br></span>
Coma is a state of deep unconsciousness due to brain injury in some way. The person will be able to breathe on his own without artificial ventilation. The brain still functions which can be proved by performing tests and can heal in state of coma.<br>
On the other hand, brain death is an irreversible condition which results from a severe brain injury or hemorrhage which causes the brain activity to stop. This can happen after a major road accident or bleeding in the brain due to stroke.<br><br>
<span>9. When must organs be removed?<br></span>
Organs must be removed as soon as possible after the determination of brain death, while circulation is being maintained artificially.<br><br>
<span>10. Which organs can a living person donate?<br></span>
A living person can donate one of his/her kidneys, a part of liver, a part of pancreas only to his/her blood relatives according to the THO Act 1994 (Transplant of Human Organs Act 1994).<br><br>
<span>11. Will my decision to be a donor affect my medical care?<br></span>
Not at all. Doctors who work to save life are not the same professionals who are involved in transplantation and organ donation. The organ recovery process starts only after all efforts to save your life have been exhausted and death has been legally declared.<br><br>
<span>12. Will organ donation leave my body disfigured and affect my funeral arrangements?<br></span>
No. The organs are recovered by well trained surgeons with great care causing no disfigurement of the body. Furthermore, donation does not alter or delay funeral arrangements.<br><br>
<span>13. Who will be the organ recipient?<br></span>
The donated organs are matched with recipients on the basis of<br>
urgency of transplantation, medical suitability on testing, duration<br>
on waiting list and location.<br>
The organs are first offered in the state, and if no match is found then they are offered regionally and then nationally, until a suitable recipient is found.<br><br>
<span>14. Are there any religious objections to organ donation?<br></span>
Most religious groups support the concept of organ donation.<br><br>
<span>15. Can organs be donated after home death?<br></span>
•Only eyes and some tissues can be removed after death at home/ after cardiac death.<br>
•Heart, lungs, etc cannot be used as organs have to be removed only after brain death in hospital when blood circulation is maintained in the body.<br><br>
<span>16. Does Govt. of India give financial support for organ transplantation?<br></span>
Yes<br>
Govt. of India has initiated NOTP (National Organ and Transplant Program) which supports people below poverty line for the cost of transplantation and cost of immunosuppressant medications for one year.<br><br>
<span>17. How can I become a donor?<br></span>
•Organ donation wish is registered as donor pledge by a person more than 18yrs of age in his lifetime.<br>
•While taking pledge person can choose which organs he wants to donate after his death.<br><br>
<span>18. Can I later withdraw or revoke my consent to become an organ donor?<br></span>
Yes. You can change your decision and withdraw to consent to be an organ donor. Just tear the donor card. Also, inform your family that you no longer wish to be an organ donor.<br><br>
